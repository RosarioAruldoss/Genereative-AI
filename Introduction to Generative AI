Introduction to Generative AI
Today's session is all about stories - The history of AI, its development and stuff like that. We will also learn what we should look for in Generative AI, how to apply it, and how to build these.

AI tech has been here long since the 1960s. However, we hear about it a lot nowadays because of the current rapid developments in the field of AI technology and the widespread applications and acceptance. 
The most important reason is that now, AI can communicate among themselves. For example: A recommendation AI in Netflix can communicate with the chess-playing AI using the NLP. 
In the past, to communicate with the computer people have to learn advanced programming languages like Java, C, C++ etc. Now computers can understand the language we speak because of the impact of AI.

Types of AI


Soon, we’ll be able to achieve AGI—Artificial General Intelligence. It's like a singularity, and at this point, AI will surpass human intelligence and be better than humans at every task.

https://x.ai/ called as grok.ai from twitter-X used to generate AI images

The predecessor of any AI based application like chat gpt, claud, grok is text prediction in the keyboard application.
Now the ai can even generate videos at 4 k clarity.

These are the similar AI to models in Generative AI as per the country

Large Language Models: These are the language models that is used to train AI to do human like tasks at the fraction of the cost,
Foundational Models:  These are the language models that are built form the scratch.

[Info] The chinese AI model - deepseek only took $6,000,000/- to train their models. However the other models like LLama / Chat GPT took 300-400 Million.
Deep Seek is not even a full AI company. They are a quantitative hedge fund firm who were able to achieve this milestone in AI Tech.

Companies where we can make money in AI


[info] I can ask any questions related to the course to ask aditya in the LMS section.

Perplexity : for AI based research with source materials. It uses chat GPT in the backend.
Gamma: is used to generate PPT with the image generation models like dolly, stable diffusion, midjourney

Even though they are making losses they will make huge profits in the future. Eg. Microsoft laughed at Apple for launching an iPhone for $500 in 2007.


You can approach a business owner who is hinking about implementing AI in his new business, that is where you go and showcase your talent and achieve a massive salary hike.
We can build Saas products, language models and make tons of money
You can start your own automation agency and start making income.

[info] In the future AI will get integrated with Robots using Large Modular Models and they will be able to analyse the real world and make real-world-based decisions.

[info] Google AI studio: This language model can understand everything from text to audio to video. It is also able to understand things through computer vision.
